# Bio_2.0

This is an evolved form of the previously submitted bio project. Here, you can 
see projects I've worked on individually and in a group, all hosted on Github. 
I have also included links to my Github page, LinkedIn page, and my resume. 
Feel free to ask me any questions at the provided contact email address and happy 
scrolling.

# Home Page

The home page has a greeting and 3 buttons in the main body, which will take you
to my LinkedIn page, Github profile page, and resume hosted on Google Docs, 
respectively. 

The live website can be reached at:
[Bio_2.0 Home Page](https://jonmakesitbetter.github.io/Bio_2.0/)

# Portfolio Page

The portfolio page features some of the projects I have worked on and 
there are links that will take the user to either the live website or
the Github repository where they are stored.

# Contact Page

The contact page is simply that - my contact information.
